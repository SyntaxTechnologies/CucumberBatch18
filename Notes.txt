Class 1 -

Cucumber -

Cucumber - cucumber is a tool
Gherkin - gherkin is a language
BDD - BDD is an approach (behavioral driven development)


cucumber is a tool which allows us to write gherkin language that helps us implementing BDD approach in test automation.

whenever we write BDD scenarios, we will write from end user point of view.

Given - pre condition
when - performing actions
Then - expected result
And - supporting tag

every test case in cucumber will be considered as scenario.

why framework -

no reporting strcuture in selenium
no proper execution point
no proper segregation of screens of the application


group id  - org.syntax
artifact id - CucumberBatch18

under src - we have 2 folders
main - developing the application
test - test the application

delete main - we don't need it
 in test - we need 2 things

 technical - java
 non - technical - resources

 the end goal is to test the application
 functional testing - UI
