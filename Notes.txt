Class 1 -

Cucumber -

Cucumber - cucumber is a tool
Gherkin - gherkin is a language
BDD - BDD is an approach (behavioral driven development)


cucumber is a tool which allows us to write gherkin language that helps us implementing BDD approach in test automation.

whenever we write BDD scenarios, we will write from end user point of view.

Given - pre condition
when - performing actions
Then - expected result
And - supporting tag

every test case in cucumber will be considered as scenario.

why framework -

no reporting strcuture in selenium
no proper execution point
no proper segregation of screens of the application


group id  - org.syntax
artifact id - CucumberBatch18

under src - we have 2 folders
main - developing the application
test - test the application

delete main - we don't need it
 in test - we need 2 things

 technical - java
 non - technical - resources

 the end goal is to test the application
 functional testing - UI

Given user is navigated to HRMS application
When user enters admin username and password
And user clicks on login button
Then user is successfully logged in

User story - search an employee in HRMS
Scenario 1 - search employee by ID
Scenario 2 - search employee by name

Class 2-

recap -
Cucumber allows us to write scenarios in gherkin language
as a maven project, we created the framework skeleton

main
test - here we write code to test the application
java - for all the technical parts
resources - for all the non tech parts

feature file - in this, we write scenarios
steps package - to keep all step defs

utils  package is for all the utility classes

We need to control the flow of execution
to execute all the test cases
to execute some of the test cases
to execute one of the test cases
